/* To write media queries for four different screen sizes, you can target specific ranges of widths to cater to various devices. Here's an example of how you can write media queries for four different screen sizes: */

/* ```css */
/* / Styles for Extra Small Devices (phones) / */
@media only screen and (max-width: 576px) {
    /* / CSS styles for phones / */
}

/* / Styles for Small Devices (tablets) / */
@media only screen and (min-width: 577px) and (max-width: 768px) {
    /* / CSS styles for tablets / */
}

/* / Styles for Medium Devices (small laptops/desktops) / */
@media only screen and (min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 992px) {
    /* / CSS styles for small laptops/desktops / */
}

/* / Styles for Large Devices (large laptops/desktops) / */
@media only screen and (min-width: 993px) {
    /* / CSS styles for large laptops/desktops / */
}

/* ```
In this example:
- Styles specified under the first media query will apply to devices with a maximum width of 576px (e.g., phones).
- Styles under the second media query will apply to devices with widths between 577px and 768px (e.g., tablets).
- Styles under the third media query will apply to devices with widths between 769px and 992px (e.g., small laptops/desktops).
- Styles under the fourth media query will apply to devices with a width of 993px and above (e.g., large laptops/desktops).

By setting up these media queries, you can customize your website's layout and design to suit different screen sizes and provide a responsive experience for users across a range of devices. */
